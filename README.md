Hello, I'm Vihit. I love experimenting and learning new things. I have trained and fine tuned foundational models, worked on deep learinng applications and built web and mobile apps.

Currently, I’m working on a brain–computer interface (BCI) project, where we’re developing software to measure brainwave signals and extract features that let users play simple games using only their brain activity.
